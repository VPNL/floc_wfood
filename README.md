Contains Anthony Stigliani's floc stimuli with updated food category. All stimuli has been run through SHINE toolbox to control for low-level image properties (Tanaka et.al, 2010). 

Static condition stimuli for faces, hands, cars, and scenes categories were adapted from Anthony Stigliani's fLoc package (Stigliani et al., 2015). Static condition stimuli for the food category were adapted from Nidhi Jain's code for food stimuli.
