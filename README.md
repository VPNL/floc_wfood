# floc_wfood

Contains Anthony Stigliani's floc stimuli (Stigliani 2015) and includes new food category. All stimuli has been run through SHINE toolbox (Willenbockel 2010) to control for low-level image properties. 

Static condition stimuli for faces, hands, cars, and scenes categories were adapted from Anthony Stigliani's fLoc package (Stigliani 2015). Static condition stimuli for the food category were adapted from Nidhi Jain's food stimuli (Jain 2023).
